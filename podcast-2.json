Anrufen is to call. How would you say I call? Ich rufe an. You see it's a separable verb. Ich rufe an. How would you say you call? Du ruft an. How would you say I call you? Ich rufe dich an. You see it's an accusative verb. So it triggers accusative endings and articles and pronouns. Ich rufe dich an. How would you say when do you call me? Wann rufst du mich an? You see an is at the end. Keep in mind, remember, whenever you have two parts of verbs or you have two verbs, the second part in German is kicked to the very end. How would you say I call you tomorrow at three o'clock? Ich rufe dich morgen um drei Uhr an. How would you say when do you call me tomorrow? Wann rufst du mich an? How would you say I can call you tomorrow at three o'clock? Ich kann dich morgen um drei Uhr anrufen. You see, ich kann dich anrufen. I can call you. And you see the structure in German is I can you tomorrow at three o'clock call. Ich kann dich morgen um drei Uhr anrufen. So we have two verbs k\u00f6nnen, what you can do and anrufen is now together because it's the second verb. How would you say can you call me tomorrow? Kannst du mich morgen anrufen? So you see the structure is can you me tomorrow call? Kannst du mich morgen anrufen? How would you say yes I can call you tomorrow? Ja, ich kann dich morgen anrufen. How would you say yes I call you tomorrow? Ja, ich rufe dich morgen an. You see if you just use anrufen it's separable. If you use it together with another verb like k\u00f6nnen then it's the second verb and it's together. Ich kann dich anrufen. I can call you. Or ich rufe dich an. I call you. How would you say I call you tomorrow if I have time? Ich rufe dich morgen an, wenn ich Zeit habe. You see if I time have, wenn ich Zeit habe. Wenn you remember introduces a sub clause and the verb is kicked to the end. So when kicks all the verbs to the end. How would you say I don't call you tomorrow if I don't have time? Ich rufe dich morgen nicht an, wenn ich keine Zeit habe. Keine Zeit. No time. If I have no time. Wenn ich keine Zeit habe. And you can also start with a sub clause. How would you say if I have time I call you tomorrow? Wenn ich Zeit habe, rufe ich dich morgen an. You see, wenn ich Zeit habe, the verb is at the end and now the next verb follows as if both verbs are kissing each other. Wenn ich Zeit habe, rufe ich dich morgen an. If I time have, call I you tomorrow. Wenn ich Zeit habe, rufe ich dich morgen an. How would you say if I no time have, call I you tomorrow not? So actually if I don't have time, I don't call you tomorrow. Wenn ich keine Zeit habe, rufe ich dich morgen nicht an. How would you say in the past I called you? Ich habe dich angerufen. So you see the structure is like I have you called. Ich habe dich angerufen. How would you say I called you yesterday? Ich habe dich gestern angerufen. How would you say I didn't call you yesterday? Ich habe dich gestern nicht angerufen. How would you say why haven't you called me yesterday? Warum hast du mich gestern nicht angerufen? Angerufen is the participle for the past. Since it is a separable verb, the GE slips in between. That's why we call it separable verb. Great, next time we'll go through the verb schaffen to succeed or to accomplish. Like when you say I've accomplished this task. So here's what I want you to do now. Take this verb now and juggle it around. Build just three simple sentences saying them out loud. Just three simple sentences. This will take you just one minute. In the next episode you'll hear my take on this verb. So talk to you soon. Bis bald.

The end."}, "podcast_summary": "In this podcast, the speaker discusses the verb \"anrufen,\" which means to call. They demonstrate how to conjugate the verb in various sentences and explain that it is a separable verb, meaning that the prefix is separated from the verb when conjugating. They also discuss how the verb triggers accusative endings and articles in sentences. The speaker then provides examples of using the verb in different scenarios, such as asking when someone will call and discussing the ability to call. They also touch on using the verb in the past tense and provide examples of sentences using the past tense. At the end of the podcast, the speaker encourages the listener to practice using the verb in three simple sentences and teases the topic for the next episode, which will focus on the verb \"schaffen.\"", "podcast_guest": {"name": "herprofessor", "organization": "", "summary": ""}, "podcast_highlights": "In this podcast, the speaker teaches how to use the German verb \"anrufen\" (to call) in different sentences. They explain that \"anrufen\" is a separable verb, meaning its prefix can be separated from the base verb. They provide examples of sentences using different pronouns and verb tenses, as well as sentences with additional verbs such as \"k\u00f6nnen\" (can) and subclauses using \"wenn\" (if). They also briefly mention the past tense form of \"anrufen\" and mention that the GE particle is inserted between the prefix and the base verb. The speaker concludes by assigning the listeners to create three simple sentences using the verb \"schaffen\" (to succeed/accomplish) for the next episode."}
