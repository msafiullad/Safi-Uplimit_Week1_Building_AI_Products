My name is Vince Warga and welcome to the show. I'm very excited to share today's episode with you. I talked to Matap Tadayon. She is a software developer, YouTuber and Google Developer expert for Flutter and Dart. She is the founder of the Flutter Explained YouTube channel, where Matap and Max publish videos about Flutter, live coding, Flutter news and tutorials. So if you are not a subscriber yet, definitely check out the Flutter Explained YouTube channel. And a quick disclaimer, she is also my colleague at Media Mart Saturn. She shared her story on how she switched from industrial engineering to software development and how she learned coding while traveling, how she got her first developer job, gave her first talks, the importance of meetups and mentors, and how she eventually became a Google Developer expert. You will find links in the show notes to all the things we talked about. Before we start the episode, I'm sorry for the low sound quality from my side. I had to record this episode while traveling and I didn't have access to my usual microphone. Then let's get this started. I hope you will enjoy this episode with Matap. Welcome Matap, thank you for joining us today. Hey Vince, thank you for having me and inviting me, it's a pleasure. Would you please briefly introduce yourself? Yes, for sure. So my name is Matap Tadayan. I'm a software engineer or Flutter Developer at Media Mart Saturn. And I'm actually a colleague of you. So, and also, a piece of that, I'm the founder and content creator of the Flutter Explained YouTube channel, where Max and I are creating tutorial videos for Flutter about Flutter and, yeah, general topics about development. And I'm also a Google Developer expert since a couple of months. And beside of that, I'm also a member of the Flutterista community. Probably you have heard about it. The reason why I invited you today, of course, we are also colleagues at Media Mart. So that's one reason. But I also saw your talk at the Flutteristas conference in Atrial this year. And you talked about how you get from zero programming knowledge to basically becoming a software developer or software engineer in two years. And I think this topic would be very interesting to share with the podcast listeners. I would like to hear your story. Yes, for sure. So actually, I studied industrial engineering at the university. So I completed my bachelor degree in Iran. And after that, came to Germany to continue my master degree, also in industrial engineering. I completed my university and got my university degree and was super excited about I finally start to work as a real someone who really earns some money and not a student job anymore. So after that was back in 2015, I started to work as an internal account manager at one industrial company in Germany. The company was an international company and they produce some pipelines for big companies. And so they created components and such staff, which was at that time very interesting for me. But sooner or later, I would say that was around two years. After this time, I realized that this is nice to have and this is nice to work there. But they don't challenge me enough. And I wanted to have some changes. That was the main reason why I decided to start and to search for something different. But I should also say that I earned so good at that time that was not such an easy decision just to quit and start to something different. Therefore, beside of my work, I started to Google and search for some other opportunities. And I wanted also in high school to get a bit more into programming and coding and do some fancy, I don't know, creating app, creating web and such stuff. And at that time, I said, why not? Let me give it a try and see if it works for me. So I looked for some courses which I could do beside of my main job. And I found the Udacity platform. Probably you have heard about it. And there's a platform where you can do some courses and they actually offer many different topics. And one of the courses that they offer was Intro to Programming, non-degree. And I started with that. So I started to learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a bit of Titan. I do have one question about basically your past career. How much programming do you learn as an industrial engineer? Because, for example, I studied physics, everyone is surprised that we learn to code. I mean, some people are surprised that we had a lot of programming. And I was curious, how much programming do you have as an industrial engineer? To be honest, we didn't have any. So no, probably it's wrong. I had a bit of visual basic in bachelor degree. And after that, in my master's degree, I had, for example, some general topics such as how to do the project management for software development, for software development companies or require management for creating a software or something like that. But really getting deep into coding and programming was actually not the case for us. OK, OK. So you decided to change careers. Then you started with Udacity, right? Yeah, exactly. So I started with Udacity with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and a little bit of Python, which was great. And this course took me, I think, for around five, six months. And that was actually the basic of programming for me, learning about code and learning about how the stuff is working. And in this course, we had a different assignment, which we had to provide. And we had small projects and questions that we had to answer and got feedback from the mentors and such stuff. And do you remember some of the smaller coding challenges that you had during the nanodegree? Yeah, actually, one of them, I would say that was, I think, the last project that I did. That was a memory project where you have to flip the cards to find the right cards. And I had to do that with, I think, with Python. And that was just horrible for me. That was really challenging and hard, but at the end, I could overcome that and complete it, which the final result was really amazing. And I was really proud of what I created, for sure. And what did you do after Udacity or how did you continue after the nanodegree? So after the nanodegree, I was pretty sure that I would like to stay in this field and continue. I learned more about software development. And the first decision to make for me was at that time to quit my job so that I can focus on my career as a software developer. And I was lucky enough because my partner and I decided at that time to go on board travel. So I quit my job, he quit his job, and we went actually to travel around the world a bit. And at this time, that was six months round the board. And at this time, I tried to figure out more and more about, yeah, to create a small website, to deep dive in different, I would say, program languages that they had at that time, and also do some coding challenges and such stuff to just stick with coding. Because I can remember that just small stuff at that time was for me not self-explanatory. So I needed a lot of actually practices. And therefore, that was important for me to stay and stick with the programming at that time. And how could you basically manage traveling and learning programming at the same time? So how could you stay on track and how could you manage your time? Yeah, it's a very good question because many people think that when you are traveling around the world, you are just traveling and chilling and things like that. But that was actually not the case. And besides traveling, we started to create our blog and create a website, create a WordPress website, which was more like WordPress. But I had, for example, to do just some small adjustment with CSS or to do some animation and such stuff. And these small examples was for me at that time, somehow also some practices. And besides of that, I should admit I have a partner who is very motivated to motivating me to stick to programming. And we did some, for example, we each of us pick up some challenges. Yeah, and my partner and I did, for example, some exercise where he picked up a challenge and I really decided to overcome that or completed that. And that was somehow a competition between us a bit so that we can motivate each other. And to be honest, if you are going on travel and you don't have a home base, you can't just travel around. So it's also exhausting. And sometimes or some days you just enjoy if you can stay in your Airbnb room or in your hotel room and do some other stuff. And for us at this time, we decided to just create our own website or we did also some YouTube videos where you can probably also still find it, but don't Google for that. And yeah, and also did a bit of coding. Okay, okay. So you were on basically you were traveling around the world, you were learning coding and how did you so what happened next? How did you get your first job or did you get your first job immediately? Or how was that? Yeah, after six months, we arrived in New Zealand and in New Zealand, we decided to stay a bit longer. So that was not we didn't want to stay a couple of weeks rather than we wanted to at least be there for six months or longer, probably to have a working holiday visa, which we had at that time and say for one year. And that was a great time for me to dig deeper, actually, into programming. And I was looking for some opportunity to do an internship or such a stuff. And for that, I went to different meetups and tech talks in New Zealand. That was we were in Christchurch. This is in the South Island of New Zealand. And there I could meet different entrepreneurs and startup companies. And that was a great opportunity and connection with the new people for me, because I just talked with them. I told them my story and what is my next step or what I want to do as next. And so I came into communication and into some to do some relation with them. And that was great at that time, because out of this communication with different people, I could manage an internship for three months. So I got an internship in a startup, which was on site at the time. And they were creating an application for the farmers and contractors. And yeah, they give me this opportunity and I could start as the intern there. And in this three months, I could learn about programming with Zamarine, about writing into end test with Katalon, or, for example, to work or to learn, or I would say also to hear for the first time about CI CD pipeline and also about general topics of software development, which you don't actually or I didn't actually learn about them in any courses, such as, for example, how the daily work of software development looks like, how does software architecture look like, or, for example, agile methodology and the Scrum team, how does it work? And to have this whole picture of this daily work of software development was really helpful for me to get to get it better, to understand it better and decide for me if I want to stay or to stay in this path. How did you find Flutter? And so basically you are now you came from JavaScript, Python to Zamarine. It sounds like Flutter is somewhere, somewhere close in your career. Is that correct? Yeah, exactly. And these three months show me that I actually would love to stick with app development. But after these three months, I was also pretty sure that I don't like to stick with Zamarine. So that was nice time. And that was nice to learn a lot about it. But yeah, that was not what I wanted to stick with that. And after these three months, I decided to come out or that was actually this three months of internship and after that, I was again, I had more time to do this. I was again, I had more time to figure out the next steps and the next challenges for me. And for that, I actually after we came back to Germany, that was end of 2019, I wanted I looked for that and I Google a bit. And so I found Flutter to write the cross platform applications. And that was in that time, very interesting for me that I can actually have one code base and create iOS, Android and also web application, which was motivating me much more to learn more about that. And for that, I started with a Udemy course of Angular U to learn about more about Flutter. And at that time, I was actually also pretty active in Twitter. And to have so in Twitter, probably you also know that you're also active in Twitter. It's the Flutter community is very active, right? Yeah. And there I got very good insights and from the Flutter members and how they are motivating and supporting each other was also one of the reasons what I thought I can give the Flutter try and see if this is something for me, which I can imagine to work longer with that. And with the Udemy course of Angular U, that was a pretty good start for me. I did the course. And after that time, for me, that was just clear that, yeah, this is going to be the way where I want to go. And I want to stick with that. And after that, I started to create some small application with also again with Max. We started to create a small application about the traveling, which we missed somehow on our world travel. And yeah, with the, for example, the Firebase authentication and such a step. And that was a great time at the time to get deeper into Flutter. But unfortunately, after a couple of months where we are working on that, the COVID hit up and our idea with traveling and creating application for some travelers were not much. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It didn't make sense anymore. Right. No, no, unfortunately not. So that was nice try and we came pretty far actually. But after this time we thought, yeah, let's put it on the side and probably we'll grab it again someday. But yeah, with that, I tried to go deeper into Flutter. And besides of that, I started also with Max, the YouTube channel. So actually he started that. And after a while I joined him for creating the tutorial videos. Oh, okay. And Katju, could you say a little bit more about your YouTube channel? Yeah, for sure. So Fluttexplained is the name of the YouTube channel and we are creating technical tutorials. And I also started a couple of videos till now. And tomorrow is actually the next video that has come out about the object box. And what I like or love about creating YouTube videos is that if you want to explain a topic to your audience, you have to learn and understand it so well that you can explain it. So that means for me, I would say as a beginner at the time, it was a great way to learn better about what I wanted also to teach to someone else. And it helped me a lot to go deeper and understanding the different topics that I wanted to present on our channel. Yeah, that was the benefit of that, for example, for me on YouTube channel. But yeah, in general, on our YouTube channel, you can find different tutorial about Flutter Dart. We did also a couple of live coding. Max is at the moment also active with other live codings where he is programming some, I don't know, some applications and also some coding challenges or something of such stuff. So if you are interested, subscribe to our channel as well. Okay, awesome. And basically, you started doing videos about Flutter even before you got your first Flutter job, right? Yeah, exactly. Okay. Were you also already active with talks at meetups and online meetups as well? How did you get your first Flutter job? I started with the YouTube tutorials on our YouTube channel. And besides of that, I was also protective on Twitter. And on Twitter, for sure, you can do some connection with the other people. And I was posting also about different topics that I were interested. I did, for example, if any new videos came out and also did some conversation with different people. And out of this conversation and my post, I was asked a couple of times, for example, if I'm interested to giving a talk. And with that, I got, for example, the opportunity to talk on a different community. And because of the COVID, at the moment, everything is also online, which was good for me at the time that I could just give online talks. I gave a talk about flavors. I gave also talk about animation or slivers. Or my last talk was in April, as you mentioned before, on the Flutteristas, about my journey actually to become a software developer. And probably it's worth to mention also for people who doesn't know or hear about Flutterista, that Flutterista is actually a worldwide community for people whose gender identity is either female or non-binary and are interested in Flutterstika. So our community is getting actually bigger and bigger every day. And yeah, if anyone is interested, just go to Flutteristas, Google for that. And you can see that you can sign up for the community. It's actually a great place where you can exchange your knowledge or give support, get some support, or also talk with other community members. And we have also some meetups or presentations on a monthly basis that you can also join. OK, sorry, that was a long answer for the first question. And what was the second question now? Yeah, the second question was basically how you got your first Flutter job. Yeah. And OK, beside of all this stuff, I think that was last year in summer. I had the feeling that I'm confident enough now to apply for Flutter Developer role. And so in summer, I started to search a bit for different opportunities. But at that time, I can remember there were not so many actually positions for Flutter. But I was lucky enough that on LinkedIn, I found the advertisement for the current Flutter position that I have actually. And I thought, why not? I will give it a try. And they wanted a junior Flutter developer, where our boss was searching for. And I applied for that. And after a couple of days, I got a response from them that they would love to have an interview with me. And the interview was very interesting for me because I had the feeling that the main and the most important thing was also for the interview to have someone who is motivated, to have someone who is willing to learn and to someone who is for sure try to expand his knowledge about Flutter. And yeah, that's what this for sure bring also some Flutter experience with himself. And yeah, with that, I got the I went to the first interview and I think in the second interview, I had a coding challenge where I had to code and create a small application with Flutter and different plugins that they are required for that. And yeah, in the second interview, I had to introduce my application. I had to talk about my code and why I decided for this way or this plugin and how did I implement it. And yeah, answer some questions. And the third interview was about getting to know the team. And after the third interview, I got the job. Oh, nice. And do you think that because basically even before you applied for the job, you already created videos on YouTube about Flutter. Do you think or do you think it helped when applying for that position or what was it even mentioned during the interview? I would say yes. It was for sure a benefit for me. And out of a couple of reasons, they actually saw that I'm doing or I'm working with Flutter and my GitHub repository was pretty active in that time because, yeah, I just code and use GitHub for that. And because of the videos, they could also see that I am trying to explain my code to other people and I'm able to do that. And besides of all of this, also in the interview, they were asking me how could, for example, stay motivated and why I like to create such a stuff and such a thing. And I think all of these are showing that you are motivated and you want to achieve something. I think this is just beneficial. Okay. You are also a GDE. Could you share with us your path to becoming a GDE? And say a little bit more about what it even means to be a Google Developer Expert and what are the benefits and benefits of the program, for example, for the experts? And could you maybe say a couple of words about that? Yeah, for sure. So I'm a GDE since a couple of months. And actually, I got asked after my Flutter presentation if I'm interested in that role. And I should admit that I didn't expect that. I think it's most probably is common also for many people that they think always they are not probably, I don't know, they don't think about to have this opportunity at all or they don't have the opportunity to do that. Or they think they are not good enough for this thing or such stuff. And I know that Nila is the community manager of Flutter. And she reached out to me and asked me if I am interested to be a GDE. And I was pretty surprised at the time because I was like, well, pardon what's happening now? And that is really good. And I was thinking, yeah, if she's asking me and if I can get it, why not? So I tried to understand at first and figure out what it's like to be a GDE. And after I read about it, I decided to accept her request and go for the interview. To be a GDE or a Google Developer Expert means that you are actually there for your community and you want to help other community members. This is very important for your interview, actually. This is the main, I would say, goal of being a GDE. Applying for this, I would say probably a role, you need some requirements. And for example, to give some talks is one of the requirements. To be active in the community is the other requirements. Or to writing some blog article or creating YouTube videos or creating podcasts, such as that. They are all points that you can collect to applying for the GDE. And I checked the requirements and I had most of them. So I said yes to Neelay. And after that, I got the first invitation for the GDE. There are two interviews that you have during this year application. The first one is a community interview where you have with another GDE. And there it's mainly about how active you are and why do you want to become a GDE and what is your goal and how you help the community. And the second interview is about the product interview, which was for me, for example, Dart and Flutter. And to give them the impression that you know about the stuff, you know about Flutter enough, you know about Dart enough, you get some question where you have to answer. And yeah. And after the second interview, I was accepted into this program and I became a GDE. Did I answer all your questions about GDE? Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you for answering. And also, congratulations. Thank you very much. Do you have any tips for beginners and developers in earlier phases of their career? Of course, we talked about how you got your first job and then first internship and then the first job. But do you have any suggestions and tips for beginners and developers in earlier phases of their career? How to stay motivated, how to know what to learn, how to learn, when to learn and things like that? Yeah, probably I can give a couple of advice. I think to become a software developer and become a good coder is not easy. So there is also not a shortcut, I would say, to become a software developer or become a good developer. There are, I don't know, there are some YouTube videos where they mention become software developer in just a couple of days or a couple of weeks or such an article, which is, I would say for me, at least it's not realistic. And if you want to become a software developer and you think it's going to be fun for you, give it just a try. Give it a try. Don't be hesitated. Don't make a drama out of that. Just go for it. Start with that. And I would say it's not an easy topic, not at all, but it's possible. If you love and you like to do and to have the feeling that you can solve the challenges and overcome the problems and understand the staff, it makes so much fun that you will stick to that. And for getting better and better in software development and in programming, I think it's just important to sit in front of your computer to start some projects, small projects, probably for yourself, create some staff, get stuck into a problem, sometimes also get frustrated and after that try to find a solution. And Googling is for example, just Googling was one of the biggest topics for me at the time, how to Google. I don't know. That was not easy. I think it's not actually easy to write the correct question. But if you want to do that and you want to learn that, I think you will come better and better by time. And I think also what is very important is that to take your time, create the staff, get stuck in that and don't hurry for getting, I don't know, to complete your project because next project that you will start with also somehow similar, but to understand what you are doing and also to understand it and getting deeper will help you a lot for all your future stuff. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. Another thing I wanted to ask, basically I saw a couple of your talks. I saw basically you talked about flavors in Flutter, slivers and animations. And so basically you have experience giving talks in a public forum and meetups. And I wanted to ask what your process for creating these talks are. So how do you prepare? What do you pay attention to, to make sure that your talk is interesting and short, but not too short, not too quick, but explains everything correctly. So how do you basically prepare your talks? Yeah. I think the first hard thing in creating and preparing a talk is for me at least to choose a topic, to have a right topic and some idea of what you want to talk. I think it's somehow challenging, but after you decided to have a talk, I think it's important for you to break it down so that you can understand and you can explain it in a way that the audience can understand it. And after that, I don't know, for example, if you have a talk or time for 20 minutes, don't create, I don't know, 40 slides or something like that, rather than just stick with for 20 minutes. I would say, for example, go for 10 to 12 slides and break your topics into a smaller chunk and explain it to your audience. If you want to go for some live coding, be prepared. That's always when you are giving a talk, something is going wrong and something happened probably that you are not expected. So I try always to prepare for such a staff and create a demo for that or do a recording in case something doesn't work that I can just bring it up and say, yeah, normally it should work like this and that, but it doesn't work at the moment because you can't. You don't know how the technique is working. And sometimes, I don't know, everything is weird and you get also stress and stuff like that. And yeah, you can't focus on the pressure and everything. It's going a bit, yeah, not in the right way. And for giving a talk, I think my last advice is that just do that. I know it's hard to talk about some topic in front of the people or other audience because you're always also thinking about, yeah, probably what I'm saying is not 100% correct. But to be honest, I'm always thinking about at least I'm doing that. I Google for that. I do it according to best of my knowledge and be open also for some feedback. If someone's coming to you and say the way that you are doing is not the best way because in software development, you can do or create something in I don't know how many different ways. So be open for feedback. And if someone is giving you feedback that this or that way can work better, just accept it or learn about it and take it into consideration. But don't let people that they bring you down or they'll motivate you rather than just focus on your goal and go for your talk. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Is there anything else you would like to share with the listeners that I forgot to ask? No, actually, thank you for having me, Vince. And the only thing that I would say probably from people who are self-taught software developer, I would say it's possible to be a software developer also without any background, programming background from the university or something different. And if you would like and love to be a software developer, just give it a try and stick to that and don't give it up. Awesome. And where can our listeners find you online? On which social platforms are you active on? And so you can find me actually on Twitter as mathop-online-dev and also on the YouTube channel and flat-x-planet.
